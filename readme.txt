SMS Eperiment #1

Mentors International is looking for a digital consierge for the events they hold. This experiment will be successful when I can:
1. Recieve texts from anyone, and reply
2. Answer simple questions based on keywords
3. Make interacting with a bot feel like interacting with a human
     a. Quick
     b. Variation of answers and paths to the answer
     c. Freindly

I want to create a useful service for them that treats the sender well, and does what would be expected
